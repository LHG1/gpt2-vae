dialog:
A: Nicole, you’ve been watching TV for hours today. If you watch for one    more minute, I’ll cancel our tour to Disneyland tomorrow.
B: Please, Dad! It’s Saturday today. You said I could watch more TV at weekends.
A: But you should learn to protect your eyes, sweetie. By the way, you mustn’t read while lying in the bed starting from today.
B: What about you smoking two packages of cigarettes a day, Dad?
A: Oh, you’ve got me there. I promise I’ll try to smoke less and less from now on.
B: Let’s make that a deal.
A: All right. Oh, one more thing, you must brush your teeth before you go to bed every night.
B: You can’t put your stocks in the living room！ 
A: Well, Ok. You are becoming your mom!
B: That’s because you are a “bad boy”!
