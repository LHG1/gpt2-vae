dialog:
A: Excuse me, are you the manager? 
B: Yes, I am. What can I do for you?
A: I bought the new silk scarf for my wife and when she washed it, the color faded.
B: Really? Let me have a look. This kind of thing doesn’t usually happen.
A: Yeah, it never happened to me before, but I guess there’s always the first time.
B: I suppose so. So what would you like us to do for you?
A: Dear madam, may I remind you that in front of your main entrance there is a sign: We give our customers satisfaction. I expect a little satisfaction.
B: Yes, you are right. There is a sign over there. 
A: How do you intend to solve this problem?
B: Ok, sir. We are happy to exchange it for you or a full refund if you’d like.
