dialog:
A: Hello, Amy, it’s the holiday next week. How about travelling together?
B: That’s a great idea, Anna. Where are we going? How about visiting a big city? We can go shopping.
A:  Oh, big cities are too boring. Let’s  go to the countryside. We can enjoy   the singing of birds and the beautiful views.
B: Sounds amazing. I like the countryside too. What are we going to take with us?
A: Cash, umbrella, comfortable shoes, food for animals… 
B: And a camera. We are going to take many photos.
A: Sure. Where are we going to stay? Are we going to book a hotel? 
B: No, let’s stay in a tent. I have a nice tent.
A: That’s cool!
