subject:DE L56 Demanding a Raise in Salary
dialog:
A: May I come in? 
B: Come in, please.
A: I’m sorry to trouble you, but I’d like to ask when I will get a raise. 
B: In three month.
A: You said the same thing three months ago.
B: Did I? Well, anyway, you’ll get your raise when the economy starts picking up.
A: You mean I won’t get a raise until the recession ends? 
B: Yes.
A: I get the message. I quit!
B: No, don’t be so emotional. We like you to work here, but this company is on hard times, and I can’ t handle raises for anyone.
A: I’ve been here for three years, and I haven’t had a raise all the time. If you acknowledge my work, it should be reflected in my pay.
B: Well, I’ll consider that again.
