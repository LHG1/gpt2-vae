dialog:
A: Are you getting any good sleep?
B: I was sleepy all day long at the first three months, but now it’s hard for me to fall asleep.
A: My suggestion is that lean against bedhead when you sleep. How is your appetite?
B: Not good since I have the morning sickness, but I still try to eat more for the babies.
A: That’s the right choice. Do you have other problems? 
B: Yes. I am having a bit of back pain.
A: Don’t worry about it. You are too tired for carrying a pair of twins. 
B: Is there anything I can do to make this easier?
A: Only after you give birth. Do you want to know the gender of your babies?
B: No, please don’t tell me. I like surprise. Just tell me how my babies are  doing.
A: They are pretty good there.
