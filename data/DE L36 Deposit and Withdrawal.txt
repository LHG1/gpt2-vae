dialog:
A: Good afternoon, sir. What can I do for you?
B: I need a cash withdrawal from this account. Here is the card. 
A: How much do you want to withdraw?
B: 2000 Yuan.
A: I’m afraid you cannot withdraw so much.
B: But I have checked my balance at the ATM. There is 2000 Yuan left.
A: Yes, there is, but you also have a minimum balance requirement in this  card.
B: How much is that?
A: 15 Yuan. You can withdraw 1975 Yuan at most at the moment.
B: OK. Please help me do that and  then  deposit  all the money into  this  account.
A: Sir, you don’t need the cash withdrawal. If you don’t mind, I will transfer the money directly into the other account.
B: You are right. Thank you! Would you please print a copy of my bank statement?
A: Sure. Wait a moment please.
