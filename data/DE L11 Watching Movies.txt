A: I remember that. It was a great movie. But it was definitely scary.
B: If you're not busy, do you want to come over? I'm afraid to be alone. 
A: Sure. I can come over. What should we do?
B: How about if we watch a comedy. I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense.

B: Hurry, ok. It's getting dark outside.
A: Don't worry, nothingâ€™s going to happen. I'll be there very soon.
