subject:DE L37 Match Making
dialog:
A: Hey, you look so miserable. You have to forget her. 
B: Who?
A: Your ex. You need a date. How about taking my sister, Luka, to the movies this weekend?
B: Thank you. But I don’t need a blind date. I’m not miserable, just worrying about my office work.
A: Come on, you can’t fool me. You take this as a favor. My sister also broke up with her boy friend. No, ex-boyfriend.
B: The truth is I’m not ready for another relationship. 
A: I’m not asking you to marry her. Just a date.
B: Still sounds weird to me.
A: You don’t know what you are missing. She is pretty and nice. And she gets hit on a lot.
B: Every time my friends want to set me up on a date, they always talk in this way.
A: I know I cannot persuade you to do this, but do promise me you will think about it.
B: I will.
