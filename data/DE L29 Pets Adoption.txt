dialog:
A: We are going to bicycle this Sunday. Will you join us？
B: I really want to but I have other plans，taking my dog for a vaccination. 
A: Dog? I never heard you had a dog!
B: Yes, I just adopted one, from the pets rescue center. 
A: Oh, How sweet~~ is it a puppy or an adult dog?
B: A puppy. Now I have to take care of her.
A: Breeding a puppy is not that easy, it must be stressful. 
B: It is. House-training is difficult.
A: Why didn’t you adopt an older dog? It will be easier.
B: Yes I know that. But my puppy is so adorable. I just can’t say no to her. 
A: I see.
