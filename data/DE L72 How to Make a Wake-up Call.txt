subject:DE L72 How to Make a Wake-up Call
dialog:
A: Good evening. This is Black Smith in Room 303. 
B: Good evening, Mr. Smith. What can I do for you?
A: I’m going to Tianjin early tomorrow morning. So I would like to book an early morning call.
B: Sure, Mr. Smith, what time would you like us to call you tomorrow morning?
A: Well, I’m not sure. But I have to be at the conference room of Hyatt Regency Tianjin by 10 o’clock. You wouldn’t know how long it takes to drive  to Tianjin from the hotel, would you?
B: It’s about three to three and a half hours.
A: That means I’ll have to be on the way at 7 o’clock. B: That’s right.
A: Well, in that case, I would like you to call me at 5:45.
B: Ok. So we will wake you up at 5:45 tomorrow morning. Good night, Mr. Smith. Have a good sleep.
A: Thank you. Good night.
