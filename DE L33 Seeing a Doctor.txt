subject:DE L33 Seeing a Doctor
dialog:
A: What are your symptoms？
B: I have a skin problem. Look at these red spots on my arms.
A: Let me have a look. Is it itchy?
B: Not at first. But then it got really itchy more and more and I tried not to  scratch them.
A: How long have you been like this?
B: Since last night. Is it an infection or something?
A: What were you doing right before you started to have these? 
B: Nothing special. I was watching TV and eating some fruits.
A: What fruits did you have? 
B: Some mangos.
A: I think you are experiencing an allergy. 
B: So I’m allergic to mangos?
A: Right. Take this prescription. Rub some ointment right away and you’ll be better soon.
B: Thank you, doctor.
