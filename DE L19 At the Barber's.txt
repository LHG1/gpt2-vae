dialog:
A: I want a new hairdo. I can show you on the magazine. 
B: Oh, that is pretty. Do you want this style?
A: Yes. Do you think it is suitable for me?
B: You would look cute with short hair. Perhaps you should go even shorter
A: I'll leave it up to you. As I said, I'm ready for a change.
B: OK. You should really think about getting highlights in your hair, too.
A: Do you think that would look good? I'm worried it will make my hair look unnatural.
B: No, it won't. The highlights are very subtle. We can do a little bit this time. If you like it, we can do more next time.
A: OK, Iâ€™ll take your advice. I count on you. By the way, how much do you charge for all these?
B: Forty dollars in total.
