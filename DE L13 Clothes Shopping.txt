dialog:
A: I like that blazer in the window.
B: Wait a minute. I’m going to get it for you.
A: May I try it on? 
B: Sure.
A: It’s a little bit oversize. How do you think?
B: It looks great on you. This is size 38 and a classical cut. 
A: I want to try a 36 anyway.
B: Let me see. Sorry, we don’t have a 36 here, but we might have it in our other stores.
A: Well, I think I’ll take 38 first. Can I exchange later when you get some 36 in? 
B: With your receipt and clothing brand on the blazer, yes!
