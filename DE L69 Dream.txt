A: What’s the matter? You look so tired. 
B: I didn’t have a good sleep last night.
A: I am so sorry to hear that. What’s the problem?
B: I had a terrible dream that I was chased by a large dog and finally I was eaten by it.
A: It was really a terrible dream.
B: Yeah, I was so scared when I woke up this morning.
