subject:DE L94 Watching a Football Game
dialog:
A: Larry, this game is really important.
B: I know! Who do you think will win? Germany or England?
A: I can’t say…
B: I agree, it’s hard to predict who will win. All I know is that I’m going to be on the edge of my seat the whole game.
A: Yes, I think I will too. How about the Germany team uniforms you bought online?
B: I’ve been waiting several weeks for it to come, but it hasn’t arrived yet. I hope it wouldn’t get lost.
A: It can’t be. Maybe it will arrive this afternoon. Did you watch other sports? 
B: Yeah a few, but for me, football is my favorite.
A: But football matches make me anxious. Let’s watch the Voice first.
B: No way! I’m more nervous when they announce the winner of the Voice. 
A: I don’t know you are fan of the Voice.
B: Well, you never know when you might learn something surprising about me.
