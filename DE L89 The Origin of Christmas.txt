subject:DE L89 The Origin of Christmas
dialog:
A: Hey, Chuck, Christmas is coming. Chinese young people are more and more enthusiastic about this western festival. Do you know the story about Christmas?
B: Yes, I know a little. Joseph and Mary used to live in a town named Nazareth. They planned to get married soon. One day, an angel came to tell Mary that she would give birth to a baby named Jesus, the son of God.
A: Amazing! And then?
B: Mary was pregnant soon, and Joseph had to take Mary back to their hometown, Bethlehem, because the King ordered all the people to get back to their hometown. It was a long journey back to hometown.
A: Oh, poor Mary and Joseph, then what happened?
B: And when they arrived at Bethlehem, it was late in the evening. There were no vacant rooms in the inn. The kind-hearted hotel keeper told them that they could spend the night in the caves in a nearby mountain. Shepherds often kept their cows and sheep in those caves. So they went there. And Joseph cleaned up a trough and put some weed on it. And then Jesus was born.
A: I know Jesus is great. What did he exactly do?
B: To save the world. Jesus preached and helped a lot of people and drove away evils.
A: How is it related to Christmas?
B: Christians hold observances to celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas Day, 25th December.
A: Wow, Chuck. How do you know this?
B: Iâ€™d learned it from western culture course in college.
